# FUNCTION-TO-CALCULATE-AVERAGE-GRADE-OF-A-STUDENT
OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
#Problem statement 1: calculating average grade of a student 
 Create a program that calculates the average grade of a student based on their scores in multiple subjects. Write a function called calculate_average_grade that takes the scores for multiple subjects score1, score2, score3 as a parameter. The function should calculate the average grade and return it.

Grades can be represented as follows:

A: 90-100
B: 80-89
C: 70-79
D: 60-69
F: Below 60
Your task is to implement the calculate_average_grade function and test it with different sets of scores. You can use any grading scale you prefer.

#Problem statement2: Calculating Fibonacci Sequence
Write a function called fibonacci_sequence that takes an integer n as a parameter and returns a list containing the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.

Your task is to implement the fibonacci_sequence function using recursion. Test your function by calling it with different values of n and printing the returned list.





Note: These assignment will allow you to practice using functions to solve real-world problems. They require you to think critically, design appropriate function logic, and use the power of functions to encapsulate functionality and improve code reusability. Have fun tackling these challenges and further enhancing your skills with functions!
